## SYNOPSIS

## SOLUTION & PROCESS



1.  Identify sticky number and the guess numbers:

    STICKY #: 29

    * The most obviously sticky number

    GUESS #s: 8 , 9&#x20;

    * [x] Check every interval between 0 and 11.&#x20;
    * [x] Start at 0, apply full pressure, try to rotate the lock, does it wiggle between whole numbers or half numbers? If whole → skip it. If half → it’s a guess number.&#x20;
    * [x] Move the lock to 1 and repeat.
    * [x] Repeat for numbers 2 through 11 until both guess numbers are found.
2.  Find 1st Number (34)

    Sticky Number + 5

    29 + 5 = 34
3. Find 3rd Number (18)
   * [x] Remainder when you do: (1st number)/4
   * [x] 34/4 → remainder of 2
   *   [x] Take your two guess numbers and add 10 to each three times

       8 18 28 38

       9 19 29 39
   *   [x] Divide each of the numbers in step B by 4. Note the two numbers that have the same remainder as your 1st number: (In this case, a remainder of 2)

       18, 38
   * [x] Decide between the two numbers.
     * [x] Go to the first number (18), apply full pressure, try to wiggle it.
     * [x] Do the same with the second number (38).
     * [x] Which one wiggles more (or is looser)? That’s your 3rd number: 18
4. Narrow down 2nd Number
   1.  Remainder + 2, add 8 four times

       4, 12, 20, 28, 36

       Remainder + 6, add 8 four times

       8, 16, 24, 32, 40→0
   2. Remove any options that are within two digits of your 2nd number&#x20;
      * Remove 20 and 16
   3.  Final options:

       4 12 20 28 36

       8 16 24 32 0
5.  Test all options until the lock opens

    34 → 4 → 18

    34 → 8 → 18

    34 → 12 → 18&#x20;

    34 → 24 → 18

    34 → 28 → 18

    34 → 32 → 18

    34 → 36 → 18

    34 → 0 → 18
6.  I got quite lucky on mine. My first attempt was correct:&#x20;

    34 → 4 → 18
