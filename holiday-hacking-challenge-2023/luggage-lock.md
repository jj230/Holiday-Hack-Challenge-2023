# Luggage Lock

## SOLUTION

1. Begin on far right number
   * [x] Apply some pressure , but not too much (the amount may vary, though, from 1 click to 5 clicks of pressure)
   * [x] Find the number that is most resistant (if multiple numbers show equal resistance OR if no numbers are resistant, increase pressure and try again)
2. Repeat the process of the far right number with the other three numbers, moving right to left
3. When complete, press the key button (should be its 6th overall click) → Lock will open

## PROCESS

1. I experimented with the one and two combinations to begin with.&#x20;
   * The first thing I realized was that the luggage would only ever open on the 6th time of pushing the key button
2. Watched help video.
   * I recognized that the 5 times before that 6th push represented different pressure levels.&#x20;
   * I learned that if I push in the key button just a little and feel resistance that would give me a clue as to what the combination was.&#x20;
3. I started with the right-most number and felt resistance on only one option.&#x20;
4. I then proceeded to the other three. With some of the buttons, I felt resistance in multiple places, but eventually with some fenangling, I got the answer and opened the luggage.
5.  **REPEATED/EXPERIMENTED TO FINE TUNE PROCESS**

    I was curious if there was a more sure way to get the answer, so I redid it.

    DISCOVERIES:

    1. Look for the number that was most resistant.
       * Some of the numbers would give a pop to notify of resistance multiple times before letting me change the dial.&#x20;
       * Upping the amount of pressure when the answer wasn’t clear gave more clarity&#x20;
         * The correct number would be almost impossible to pass.&#x20;
       * There were times I had to go around each possible number multiple times at the same pressure before a number became that sticky, but it always eventually would.&#x20;
       * Following this method, I was able to find the correct combination on the first try three times in a row.\
