# Incident Handler's Journal

**Tools/Skills: Documentation, Playbooks, Wireshark, Splunk, Chronicle, VirusTotal, Incident Response Post-Incident Analysis, Logs, linux cli, tcpdump**&#x20;

Created during Google's Cybersecurity Course based on 8 fictional scenarios. I was asked to write a journal entry in the format depicted below, including a description of the event, any tools that were used, basic information as to the W's (who, what, where, when, why), and any additional notes on thoughts or questions to consider.

### Entry 1: Phishing Email -> Ransomware

| **Description**      | <p><strong>Splunk Query from over 100,000 events.</strong> I needed to identify whether there were <strong>any possible security issues with the mail serve</strong>r by specifically looking at any failed SSH logins (over 300) for the root account at a fictional e-commerce store Buttercup Games.</p><p></p><p>There are no signs of a present security issue, but there is data that suggests the email server could be vulnerable to a brute force attack. A few ip addresses had multiple failed logins greater than 5. <strong>This suggests that there is no security control in place to manage the number of failed logins allowed.</strong> If that is the case, the configurations should be updated to reduce the possibility of a brute force attack in the future.</p><p></p><p>This incident occurred in the detection and analysis phase.</p> |
