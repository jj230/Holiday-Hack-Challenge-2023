# Sample Documentation

As someone with a B.A. in English and Mathematics, who was a math teacher department chair at a high school for 6 years, and the same school's registrar, I am adept at writing technical, non-technical, and technical-in-a-non-technical-way documentation and tailoring it to the audience. &#x20;

### With documentation, it's about understanding the following things:

1. What is the preferred format?
2. Who is the audience? (not just their name, but their expertise, their role, their preferences, their priorities, etc.)
3. What is the purpose (or purposes) of what is being written?

If I know the answers to those questions, I can write what is needed.&#x20;
