# Projects Overview

This portfolio exists to give an idea of some of the practical experiences I've had within cybersecurity as well as showcase my writing, organization, and problem-solving abilities.

I've passed the CompTIA Security+ certification exam, showing my abstract/theoretical knowledge of cybersecurity topics. I've done these projects to gain the hands-on practical experience and have documented some of them to demonstrate this experience.

I have done more than these projects, but this is a good sampling of various things I've learned and skills I've practiced with. \

I will continue to update as I learn and do more.
