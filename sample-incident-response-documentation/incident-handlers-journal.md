The password was included in the email. The employee opened the file and inputted the password. A malicious payload was then executed on their computer. The payload was verified as malicious through checking its hash with known malicious hashed files on VirusTotal.</p><p><br></p><p>57 vendors on VirusTotal flagged this file hash as malicious. It is listed as a trojan. This malware could potentially be creating a backdoor into the system. This is a high priority incident that should be escalated.</p><p><br></p><p>This occurred during the detection and analysis phase. </p> |

| **Description**       | <p>After an incident involving PII occurred, I was asked to summarize the information based on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt1Vu-kgAVXieXuJ-W1ry2SzDs5OlK1ZAcfz9yAvGrs/edit?resourcekey=0-oRD928giZ2M3B3lvzRaN_w#heading=h.sd3u1rik3a6e">a longer report</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>The organization received a ransom-note email that stated PII was stolen. Initially disregarded as spam, when an employee received a second email, they sent the email to the cybersecurity team. The cybersecurity team found the claim of stolen PII was true. The data was stolen by a forced browsing attack, where the attackers could change the url of a purchase page to access other receipts with PII. In the end, the ransom was not paid, customers were informed with help from the PR team, and the web vulnerabilities were fixed.</p><p><br></p><p>This incident covers the detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity phases.</p> |

| **Description**      | <p>Splunk Query from over 100,000 events. I needed to identify whether there were any possible security issues with the mail server by specifically looking at any failed SSH logins (over 300) for the root account at a fictional e-commerce store Buttercup Games.</p><p><br></p><p>There are no signs of a present security issue, but there is data that suggests the email server could be vulnerable to a brute force attack. A few ip addresses had multiple failed logins greater than 5. This suggests that there is no security control in place to manage the number of failed logins allowed. If that is the case, the configurations should be updated to reduce the possibility of a brute force attack in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>This incident occurred in the detection and analysis phase.</p> |
