Based on a fictional [TCP/HTTP log.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkkFlFpBInQsJ-sTH6Zhi7CYnB1lCDGkyJ1F\_bflJz0/edit?usp=sharing)

| Section 1: Identify the type of attack that may have caused this  network interruption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| The TCP log shows over 100 SYN requests in under a minute from the IP Address 203.0.113.0. The web server 192.0.2.1 seems to be experiencing a DoS attack, specifically through the malicious actor utilizing a SYN flood. The flood of SYN requests is overwhelming the web server, making it unresponsive to all requests, even legitimate ones. |

| Section 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| The flood of SYN requests is overwhelming the web server, making it unresponsive to all requests, even legitimate ones. If the web server remains unresponsive, the company could suffer damages to its reputation and finances. Customers may lose trust in the safety of the website or they may simply not want to wait for it to get back online. In either case, customers may decide to give their business to a different company. |
