# Python Scripts

### Tools/Skills 

Python - Cybersecurity, Scripting, Python - Data Science, SQL, matplotlib, pandas, numpy

---

I started learning python several years ago through codecademy. I did all of my initial learning through the context of data science. This means I also experimented with SQL as well as python libraries such as matplotlib, pandas and numpy.

This year, I've started learning python in the context of cybersecurity and scripting.&#x20;

A couple of projects I've done within this domain are below:

#### 1. [Updating ](updating-file-allowed-ip-addresses.md)[F](updating-file-allowed-ip-addresses.md)[ile - Allowed IP Addresses Script](updating-file-allowed-ip-addresses.md)

#### 2. [SSH Login Brute Forcing Script](ssh-login-brute-forcing.md)

#### 3. [SHA 256 Password Cracking](python-scripts/sha256-cracking.md)

#### 4. [Encrypted Files Brute Forcing](jj230/AIG-JobSimulation.md)
