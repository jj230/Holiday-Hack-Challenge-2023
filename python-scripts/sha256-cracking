# SHA256 Password Hash Cracking

I created this script during TCM's Python 101 for Hackers course.

On a Kali Linux VM through UTM, I created a python script for cracking a SHA256 hashed password using Sublime. I then tested it using a password I knew was in my chosen password file until it was successful.

### Code

This is the final script.

Note: Still Adding Documentation.
