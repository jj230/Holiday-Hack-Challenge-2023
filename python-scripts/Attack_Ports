# Attack Port(s) Search

I created this script while working on answering questions about an attack based on a log file in csv format. I needed to find the highest and lowest port numbers that an attacker was attacking from. I had the idea of creating a python script that would help me do this.

Relying on what I know about python and scripts already mixed with some research, I created this script in about a half hour to successfully find the specific ports and the range of ports that were attacking a system.
