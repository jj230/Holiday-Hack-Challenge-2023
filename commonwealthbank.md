## Task 1: Fraud Data Analysis - Splunk Dashboard Creation
"Analyze and visualize cyber data to uncover trends and patterns."

The company asked for a dashboard that would help gather necessary data to predict or detect fraud. They were specifically interested in the following categories: merchants, age of customers, gender of customers, category of purchases and month of purchase. Based on the specific charts the company indicated they'd like to have, I designed a dashboard in splunk for easy visualization of this data.
