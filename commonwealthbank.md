## Task 1: Fraud Data Analysis - Splunk Dashboard Creation
"Analyze and visualize cyber data to uncover trends and patterns."

The company asked for a dashboard that would help gather necessary data to predict or detect fraud. They were specifically interested in the following categories: merchants, age of customers, gender of customers, category of purchases and month of purchase. Based on the specific charts the company indicated they'd like to have, I designed a dashboard in splunk for easy visualization of this data.

## Task 3: Raise Security Awareness - Infographic
Based on [guidance given by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/protect-yourself/securing-your-accounts/passphrases/creating-strong-passphrases), I created an infographic for using passphrases instead of passwords. While this may not have prevented the phishing email, it's an easy way to increase employee awareness of being safer in general. Additionally, the more employees think about their digital safety, the less likely they will be to fall for a phishing email.

Encrypted test password:

<div align="left" data-full-width="false">

</div>

Pattern:
1st character -> same
2nd character -> shift 1 to the right of the [ASCII table]([url](https://www.asciitable.com/))
3rd character -> shift 2
4th character -> shift 3
encrypted character = character + n; given that n = character placement and placement starts at 0

Conclusion:
Encrypted Password is: 05e;e:lj
Pattern to Decrypt: shift positions --> same, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7
Decrypted Password is: 04c8a5fc
